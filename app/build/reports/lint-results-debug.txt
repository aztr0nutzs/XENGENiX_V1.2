/home/aztr0nutzs/Documents/XENGENiX/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:18: Error: Class referenced in the manifest, com.example.xenogenics.MainActivity, was not found in the project or the libraries [MissingClass]
            android:name=".MainActivity"
                          ~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingClass":
   If a class is referenced in the manifest or in a layout file, it must also
   exist in the project (or in one of the libraries included by the project.
   This check helps uncover typos in registration names, or attempts to rename
   or move classes without updating the XML references properly.

/home/aztr0nutzs/Documents/XENGENiX/app/build.gradle.kts:12: Warning: Not targeting the latest versions of Android; compatibility modes apply. Consider testing and updating this version. Consult the android.os.Build.VERSION_CODES javadoc for details. [OldTargetApi]
        targetSdk = 35
        ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "OldTargetApi":
   When your application or sdk runs on a version of Android that is more
   recent than your targetSdkVersion specifies that it has been tested with,
   various compatibility modes kick in. This ensures that your application
   continues to work, but it may look out of place. For example, if the
   targetSdkVersion is less than 14, your app may get an option button in the
   UI.

   To fix this issue, set the targetSdkVersion to the highest available value.
   Then test your app to make sure everything works correctly. You may want to
   consult the compatibility notes to see what changes apply to each version
   you are adding support for:

distributionUrl=https\://services.gradle.org/distributions/gradle-8.13-bin.zip
                ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "AndroidGradlePluginVersion":
   This detector looks for usage of the Android Gradle Plugin where the
   version you are using is not the current stable release. Using older
   versions is fine, and there are cases where you deliberately want to stick
   with an older version. However, you may simply not be aware that a more
   recent version is available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/home/aztr0nutzs/Documents/XENGENiX/app/build.gradle.kts:73: Warning: A newer version of androidx.activity:activity than 1.10.1 is available: 1.12.2 [GradleDependency]
    implementation("androidx.activity:activity:1.10.1")
                   ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "GradleDependency":
   This detector looks for usages of libraries where the version you are using
   is not the current stable release. Using older versions is fine, and there
   are cases where you deliberately want to stick with an older version.
   However, you may simply not be aware that a more recent version is
   available, and that is what this lint check helps find.

/home/aztr0nutzs/Documents/XENGENiX/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:23: Warning: Fixed screen orientations will be ignored in most cases, starting from Android 16. Android is moving toward a model where apps are expected to adapt to various orientations, display sizes, and aspect ratios. [DiscouragedApi]
            android:screenOrientation="sensorLandscape"
            ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "DiscouragedApi":
   Discouraged APIs are allowed and are not deprecated, but they may be unfit
   for common use (e.g. due to slow performance or subtle behavior).

/home/aztr0nutzs/Documents/XENGENiX/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml:10: Warning: Should explicitly set android:icon, there is no default [MissingApplicationIcon]
    <application
     ~~~~~~~~~~~

   Explanation for issues of type "MissingApplicationIcon":
   You should set an icon for the application as whole because there is no
   default. This attribute must be set as a reference to a drawable resource
   containing the image (for example @drawable/icon).
